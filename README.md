# skol_projekt

Open "index.html" for viewing and reviewing my recent project.
The stylesheet for it is "main.css".
"script.js" is necessary for a contentswitch function on the page.

The page is built to last and is modular in a few ways. You can add and remove content and sections without affecting the entire page (unless you remove the body ;) ).

For example: The ".tl-element" is a element within my ".timeline" - section that switches sides of the timeline for each new item. You can copy+paste as many of ".tl-element" as you want below eachother and it will still work, therefore = modular and scaleable.
